We are mainly interested in addressing the following questions.

# Has evolution shaped our predisposition to disease?

# How do we extract reliable information from biological experiments?

# Is Artificial Intelligence able to solve the unsolvable in evolutionary studies?

Please check [EvoGenomics.AI](https://www.evogenomics.ai/)

# Why should we transition to ethical publishing for an inclusive and accessible science?
