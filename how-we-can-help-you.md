## Bioinformatics

We can provide bespoke advice on DNA-sequencing data analysis. We are specialised in the analysis of low-coverage short-read sequencing data using [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD), [ngsTools](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools), and related software which we partly developed.

## Educational events

We have 10+ years of experience of delivering workshops across all continents and online.
We can offer bespoke training, both on theory and practicals, on population genetics, bioinformatics, and applied machine learning.
Matteo Fumagalli is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and holds a PG Certificate in University Learning and Teaching from Imperial College London.

## Seminars

We have delivered speeches or keynote addresses to a lay audience on various topics, from human genetics to evolution.

_Consultancy fees are funneled to our internal research funding to support our work. Speaker fees are donated to charity._
