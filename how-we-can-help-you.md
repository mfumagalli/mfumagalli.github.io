We develop methods and implement software for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, specifically from short-read low-coverage experimenys. 
Whilst being the main group behind [ngsTools](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools) and [ngsJulia](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia
), we also contribute to features in [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD).
Some of our most popular tools include [ngsLD](https://github.com/fgvieira/ngsLD) for the inference of linkage disequilibrium from unphased data, and a [tutorial](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) on ANGSD/ngsTools. 
We also provide the community with [ImaGene](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ImaGene) and [BaSe](https://github.com/ulasisik/balancing-selection), software for deep learning applications in population genomics.

# Consultancy

## Bioinformatics

We can provide bespoke advice on DNA-sequencing data analysis. We are specialised in the analysis of low-coverage short-read sequencing data using [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD), [ngsTools](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools), and related software which we partly developed.

## Educational events

We have 10+ years of experience of delivering workshops across all continents and online.
We can offer bespoke training, both on theory and practicals, on population genetics, bioinformatics, and applied machine learning.
Matteo Fumagalli is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and holds a PG Certificate in University Learning and Teaching from Imperial College London.

## Seminars

We have delivered speeches or keynote addresses to a lay audience on various topics, from human genetics to evolution.

_Consultancy fees are channeled into our internal resources to support our work. Speaker fees are donated to fund scholarships and studentships for students from underrepresented groups or those facing financial barriers._
